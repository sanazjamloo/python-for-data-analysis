# Access relational database with Python

# DB-API is Pythonâ€™s standard API used for accessing databases. It allows you to write a single program that works with multiple kinds of relational databases instead of writing a separate program for each one.
# The two main concepts in the Python DB-API are:

#1) Connection objects used for

# Connect to a database
# Manage your transactions.

# Following are a few connection methods:

# cursor(): This method returns a new cursor object using the connection.
# commit(): This method is used to commit any pending transaction to the database.
# rollback(): This method causes the database to roll back to the start of any pending transaction.
# close(): This method is used to close a database connection.

# 2) Query objects are used to run queries.

# This is a python application that uses the DB-API to query a database.

from dbmodule import connect

# Create connection object
connection = connect('databasename', 'username', 'pswd')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Run queries
cursor.execute('select * from mytable')
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Free resources
cursor.close()
connection.close()
